        <h2>Rockets can reach speeds of 22,000 miles per hour!</h2>
        <p>
          A typical rocket produces more than a million pounds of thrust that
          allows it to carry more than 6,000 pounds at speeds topping 22,000
          miles per hour. This is equivalent to the power generated by 13 Hoover
          Dams, carrying the weight of eight horses, and traveling at speeds 15
          times faster than a speeding bullet!

        <h2>Prior to 1926, all rockets were powered by some form of gunpowder.</h2>
        <p>
          The first rocket to use liquid fuel was created by Robert H. Goddard
          and first launched on March 16th, 1926.

        <h2>The first rocket in space was launched by Germany in 1942.</h2>
        <p>
          Germany launched the first rocket capable of reaching space in 1942.
          Dubbed the V-2 rocket, it was not actually intended for space travel.
          Instead, the V-2 was constructed as a ballistic missile during WWII.
          Nonetheless, it was revealed in a flight test to be the first man-made
          object to fly into space.

        <h2>The first rocket was invented in China around 1100 AD</h2>
        <p>
          The rockets invented in the 10th century China used solid propellants
          and were mainly used as weapons and fireworks. It was not until the
          1920s that rocket science was studied further. By the 1930s and 1940s,
          professional rocket engineering started to take off.
